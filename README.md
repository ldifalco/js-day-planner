# js-day-planner

Welcome to my day planner! 
For this assignment, the goal was to make a day planner, that presents the date in the jumbotron, color coded time slots based on past present or future, and entries persisting after refreshing.  To accomplish this, I used a combination of JS, Moment.js, JQuery, and Bootstrap.  

I found this to be possibly the most challenging assignment.  Partially because of all of the moving parts, but also as a challenge to set myself.  For example, lines 8-90 could have been shortened using an array and an index through a loop, but I decided to challenge myself to make a long if statement to get it to work as well, which was successful, as the time correlates with the color of the text boxes.  

All in all, we have a fully functional day planner that saves to local storage and is properly color coordinated.  Ready and usable!
